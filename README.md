Hey there! Thank you so much for checking “The Epic Quest”, my fanmade Super Mario Bros. X Project! This is a project that I have literally grown up creating, as it was first created back in the 2010s, with year-long hiatuses between development at times as well. Now that my project is finally complete, I am very proud to release it to all of you for your enjoyment!

What you’re about to download is a ZIP file containing the folder of my project, which is a fully-fledged 8-World game with a special 9th world. Your objective (100% Original, I know) is to rescue Princess Peach from the evil clutches of King Bowser. There are a wide variety of levels with unique gimmicks from each of the worlds, complete with enemies, features, and themes both old and new, as well as secret exits, epic minigames, extreme challenges & special levels as well!

Feel free to also relay your feedback on what could be changed or improved upon as well, whether it be gameplay, graphics, difficulty, NPC dialogue, and more! I would absolutely appreciate it, so don’t be shy!

I hope that you all enjoy playing this everlasting project of mine! It truly means the world to me, as this project has taken a LOT of time and energy. Rest assured, I have enjoyed every moment of it, and I am hopefully looking forward to your enjoyment and feedback! Your contributions will hopefully help to make this episode the best it can possibly be!

### Much Love, Unknown68D ~ 💙
